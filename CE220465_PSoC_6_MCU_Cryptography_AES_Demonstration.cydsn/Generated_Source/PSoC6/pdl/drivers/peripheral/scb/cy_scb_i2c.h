* Driver API for I2C Bus Peripheral
*
* I2C - The Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) bus is an industry-standard.
* The two-wire hardware interface was developed by Philips Semiconductors
* (now NXP Semiconductors).
*
* The I2C peripheral driver provides an API to implement I2C slave, master,
* or master-slave devices based on the SCB hardware block.
* I2C devices based on SCB hardware are compatible with I2C
* Standard-mode, Fast-mode, and Fast-mode Plus specifications as defined in
* the I2C-bus specification.
*
* Features:
* * An industry-standard I2C bus interface
* * Supports slave, master, and master-slave operation
* * Supports standard data rates of 100/400/1000 kbps
* * Hardware Address Match, multiple addresses
* * Wake From DeepSleep on Address Match
*
* \section group_scb_i2c_configuration Configuration Considerations
*
* To set up the I2C driver, provide the configuration parameters in the
* \ref cy_stc_scb_i2c_config_t structure. Provide i2cMode to the select
* operation mode slave, master or master-slave. For master modes, provide
* useRxFifo and useTxFifo. For slave mode, also provide the slaveAddress and
* slaveAddressMask. The other parameters are optional for operation.
* To initialize the driver, call the \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Init function providing
* the pointer to filled configuration structure \ref cy_stc_scb_i2c_config_t
* and the pointer to allocated context structure \ref cy_stc_scb_i2c_context_t.
* To get I2C operate with the desired data rate, the SCB clock and SCL duration
* (only applicable for master mode) must be configured. Use the SysClk driver
* API to configure SCB clock frequency and \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SetDataRate to set
* the SCL low phase and high phase duration. Refer to the technical reference
* manual (TRM) to get more information on how to configure the I2C to operate
* with the desired data rate. Call \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Enable to start the I2C
* operation after configuration is completed.
*
* Master mode operation: \n
* The master API is divided into two categories:
* \ref group_scb_i2c_master_high_level_functions and
* \ref group_scb_i2c_master_low_level_functions. Therefore there are two
* methods for initiating I2C master transactions using either low-level or
* high-level API. These two methods are described below. Only one method should
* be used at a time. They should not be mixed.
*
* * Call \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterRead or \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterWrite to
*   communicate with the slave. These functions do not block and only
*   start a transaction. After a transfer is started, the
*   \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Interrupt handles the further data transfer until its
*   completion. Therefore, \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Interrupt must be called inside the
*   user interrupt handler to make the API above work. To monitor the transfer,
*   use \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterGetStatus or \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_RegisterEventCallback
*   to register callback function to be notified about
*   \ref group_scb_i2c_macros_callback_events.
*
* * Call \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterSendStart to generate a start, send an address
*   with the Read/Write direction bit, and receive acknowledgment. After the
*   address is ACKed by the slave, the transaction can be continued by calling
*   \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterReadByte or \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterWriteByte depending
*   on its direction. These functions handle one byte per call, therefore
*   they should be called for each byte in the transaction. Note that for the
*   Read transaction the last byte must be NAKed. To complete the current
*   transaction, call \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterSendStop or call
*   \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_MasterSendReStart to complete the current transaction and
*   start a new one. Typically, do a restart to change the transaction
*   direction without releasing the bus from the master control.
*   Note that these functions are blocking and do not require calling
*   \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Interrupt inside the user interrupt handler. Using these
*   functions requires extensive knowledge of the I2C protocol to execute
*   transactions correctly.
*
* Slave mode operation: \n
* The slave operation is based on the \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_Interrupt that must be
* called inside the user interrupt handler. The Read and Write buffer must
* be provided for the slave to enable communication with the master. Use
* \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveConfigReadBuf and \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveConfigWriteBuf
* for this purpose. Note that after transaction completion the buffer must be
* configured again. Otherwise, the same buffer is used starting from the point
* where the master stopped a previous transaction.
* For example: The Read buffer is configured to be 10 bytes and the master Read
* is 8 bytes. If the Read buffer is not configured again, the next master Read
* will start from the 9th byte.
* To monitor the transfer status, use \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveGetStatus or
* use \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_RegisterEventCallback to register a callback function
* to be notified about \ref group_scb_i2c_macros_callback_events.
*
* \note
* All slave API (except \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveAbortRead and
* \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_SlaveAbortWrite) are not interrupt-protected and to
* prevent a race condition, they should be protected from the I2C interruption
* in the place where they are called.
*
* The I2C driver provides the callback functions to facilitate the low-power
* mode transition. The callback \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_DeepSleepCallback can be called
* during execution of \ref Cy_SysPm_DeepSleep; \ref Cy_SCB_I2C_HibernateCallback
* can be called during execution of \ref Cy_SysPm_Hibernate. To trigger the
* callback execution, the callback must be registered before calling the
* mode transition function. Refer to SysPm driver for more information about
* low-power mode transitions.

* manual (TRM).

    * The SCB provides an RX FIFO in hardware (consult the selected device

    * how the driver firmware reads data from the RX FIFO:
    * * If this option is enabled, the hardware is configured to automatically
    *   ACK incoming data, and interrupt is enabled to take data out of the RX
    *   FIFO when it has some number of bytes (typically, when it is half full).
    * * If this option is disabled, the interrupt is enabled to take data out of
    *   the RX FIFO when a byte is available. Also, hardware does not
    *   automatically ACK the data, firmware must tell the hardware to ACK
    *   the byte (so each byte requires interrupt processing).
    * \n <b>Typically, this option should be enabled</b> to configure hardware to
    * automatically ACK incoming data. Otherwise hardware might not get the command
    * to ACK or NACK a byte fast enough, and clock stretching is applied
    * (the transaction is delayed) until command is set. When this option is
    * enabled the number of interrupts required to process the transaction
    * is significantly reduced because several bytes are handled at once.
    * \n <b>However, there is a side effect:</b>
    * * For master mode, the drawback is that the master may receive more
    *   data than desired due to the interrupt latency. An interrupt fires
    *   when the second-to-last byte has been received. This interrupt tells
    *   the hardware to stop receiving data. If the latency of this interrupt
    *   is longer than one transfer of the byte on the I2C bus, then the
    *   hardware automatically ACKs the following bytes until the interrupt
    *   is serviced or the RX FIFO becomes full.
    * * For slave mode, the drawback is that the slave only NACKs
    *   the master when the RX FIFO becomes full, NOT when the slave write
    *   firmware buffer becomes full.
    * \n In either master or slave mode, all received extra bytes are dropped.
