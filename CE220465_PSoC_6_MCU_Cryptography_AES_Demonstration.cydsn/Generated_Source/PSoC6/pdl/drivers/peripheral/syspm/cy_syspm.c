* This is a CPU-centric power mode. It means that the CPU has entered the sleep

*
* After a wakeup from the sleep, all of the registered callbacks of the

* of the callbacks of the CY_SYSPM_DEEPSLEEP type with the CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL 
* parameter are executed that correspond to the callbacks with 
* CY_SYSPM_DEEPSLEEP type with CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY parameter calls that 
* occurred up to the point of failure.
* The deep sleep mode is not entered and the Cy_SysPm_DeepSleep() function 
* returns CY_SYSPM_FAIL.
*
* If all callbacks of the CY_SYSPM_DEEPSLEEP type with the CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY
* parameter calls return CY_SYSPM_SUCCESS, then all callbacks of the 
* CY_SYSPM_DEEPSLEEP type with the CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL parameter calls are 
* skipped and all callbacks of the CY_SYSPM_DEEPSLEEP type with the 
* CY_SYSPM_BEFORE_TRANSITION parameter calls are executed, allowing the 
* peripherals to prepare for deep sleep.
* The deep sleep mode is then entered. Any enabled interrupt can cause a wakeup 
* from the deep sleep mode.
*
* \note The last callback which returned CY_SYSPM_FAIL is not executed with the 
* CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL parameter because of the FAIL.
*
* The return values from executed callback functions with the 
* CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL, CY_SYSPM_BEFORE_TRANSITION, and CY_SYSPM_AFTER_TRANSITION
* modes are ignored.
*
* If the firmware attempts to enter this mode before the system is ready (that
* is, when PWR_CONTROL.LPM_READY = 0), then the device will go into the (LP)
* Sleep mode instead and automatically enter the deep sleep mode when the
* system is ready.
*
* The system puts the whole device into the deep sleep mode when all the 
* processor(s) is (are) in deep sleep, there are no busy peripherals, the 
* debugger is not active, and the deep sleep circuits are 
* ready (PWR_CONTROL.LPM_READY=1).
*
* The peripherals that do not need a clock or that receive a clock from their
* external interface (e.g. I2C/SPI) continue operating. All circuits using the
* current from Vccdpslp supply are under the current limitation that is 
* controlled by deep sleep regulator.
*
* Wakeup occurs when an interrupt asserts from a deep sleep active peripheral.
* For more details, see the corresponding peripheral's datasheet.
*
* \note For multi-core devices the second core, that did not participate in 
* device wakeup, remain execute the deep sleep instructions. Any deep sleep 
* capable interrupt routed to this core can wakeup it.
*
* For more details about switching into the deep sleep power mode and debug,
* refer to the device TRM.
*
* A normal wakeup from the deep sleep power mode returns to either LPActive, 
* LPSleep, Active, or Sleep, depending on the previous state and programmed 
* behaviour for the particular wakeup interrupt.
*
* After wakeup from Deep Sleep, all of the registered callbacks with
* CY_SYSPM_DEEPSLEEP type with CY_SYSPM_AFTER_TRANSITION are executed to return 
* peripherals to Active operation. The Cy_SysPm_DeepSleep() function returns 
* CY_SYSPM_SUCCESS. No callbacks are executed with CY_SYSPM_DEEPSLEEP type with 
* CY_SYSPM_BEFORE_TRANSITION or CY_SYSPM_AFTER_TRANSITION parameter, if deep 
* sleep mode was not entered.
*
* \param waitFor Selects wait for action. See \ref cy_en_syspm_waitfor_t.
*
* \sideeffect
* This side effect is applicable only for devices with UDB IP block available. 
* You can obtain unpredictable behavior of the UDB block after the device wakeup
* from Deep Sleep.
* Unpredictable behavior scenario:
* * The first core saves non-retained UDB configuration registers and goes into
* the Deep Sleep (Cy_SysPm_DeepSleep() function).
* * These non-retained UDB configuration registers are modified in runtime by 
* another (second) active core.
* * The second core saves non-retained UDB configuration registers and goes into
* the Deep Sleep (Cy_SysPm_DeepSleep() function).
* These conditions save different values of the non-retained UDB configuration
* registers. The prevented scenario: on the first core wakeup, these registers 
* are restored by the values saved on the first core, and after the second core 
* wakeup, these registers are "reconfigured" by the values saved on the second 
* core.
* Be aware of such a situation.
*
* \sideeffect
* This function clears the Event Register of CM4 core after wakeup from WFE.
*
* \sideeffect
* This function changes the the slow and fast clock dividers to 
* CY_SYSPM_CLK_DIVIDER right before entering into the deep sleep and restores 
* these dividers after the wakeup.

****************************************************************************//**
*
* Sets device into the low power mode.
*
* The low power (LPActive/LPSleep) modes are similar to the active/sleep modes.
* The difference is that the current is limited and some functions have limited 
* features/performance.
*
* The feature of the low power mode is the limited current. Restrictions are 
* placed on the clock frequencies and allow the peripherals to achieve 
* a current limit.
*
* Before entering the low power mode, the user should configure the system so 
* the total current drawn from Vccd is less that the value presented in the 
* technical reference manual (TRM). Refer to the TRM for the maximum load for 
* low power operation and clock limitations in the low power mode with different
* core supply regulator voltages.
*
* * Peripherals can use the knowledge of the LPActive/LPSleep mode to make
* trade-offs that consume less current. For more details, see the corresponding
* peripherals' datasheet.
* * High-speed clock sources are available with the appropriate pre-divider 
* settings to limit the system current.
* Refer to the TRM for the maximum frequency values for low power operation 
* using different Core Regulators output voltages.
*
* Puts the device into the low power mode. Prior to entering the low power mode,
* all the registered CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY 
* parameter are called. This allows the driver to signal if it is not ready to 
* enter the low power mode. If any CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with the
* CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY parameter call returns CY_SYSPM_FAIL, the remaining
* CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with the CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY parameter 
* calls are skipped.
*
* After a CY_SYSPM_FAIL all of the CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with 
* CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL parameter are executed that correspond to the 
* CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY parameter calls 
* that occurred up to the point of failure. Low Power mode is not entered and 
* the Cy_SysPm_EnterLpMode() function returns CY_SYSPM_FAIL.
*
* If all CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with the CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY 
* parameter calls return CY_SYSPM_SUCCESS, then all CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE 
* callbacks with CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL calls are skipped and all 
* CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with the CY_SYSPM_BEFORE_TRANSITION parameter
* calls are executed. This allows the peripherals to prepare for low power.
* The low power mode is then entered.
*
* After entering the low power mode, all of the registered 
* CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with the CY_SYSPM_AFTER_TRANSITION parameter 
* are executed to complete preparing the peripherals for low power operation. 
* The Cy_SysPm_EnterLpMode() function returns CY_SYSPM_SUCCESS. 
* No CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with the CY_SYSPM_BEFORE_TRANSITION or 
* CY_SYSPM_AFTER_TRANSITION parameter are executed, if the low power mode is not
* entered.
*
* \note The last callback which returned CY_SYSPM_FAIL is not executed with 
* the CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL parameter because of the FAIL.
*
* The return values from executed callback functions with the 
* CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL, CY_SYSPM_BEFORE_TRANSITION, and CY_SYSPM_AFTER_TRANSITION
* modes are ignored.
*
* \note The callbacks are not executed if the device is already not in 
* the low power mode.
*
* \return

    ****************************************************************************//**
    *
    * Switch the power supply regulator to Single-Input Multiple Output (SIMO) 
    * Buck regulator instead of Linear regulator. The SIMO Buck core regulator 
    * provides two outputs using one external inductor and can supply Vccd with 
    * higher efficiency than the Linear core regulator (LDO) under some 
    * conditions, such as high external supply voltage.
    *
    * Before changing from LDO to SIMO Buck, ensure that:
    * * The circuit board has connected Vccbuck1 to Vccd and also populated the 
    * necessary external components for the SIMO Buck regulator, including an 
    * inductor and a capacitor for each output.
    * Refer to the device TRM for more details.
    *
    * * The operating frequency is reduced so it is within the static timing 
    * closure limits at the new frequency.
    * 
    * * The current consumption on the core is reduced to meet the 0.9 V (nominal)
    * output voltage. The main reason is that while changing from LDO to SIMO Buck,
    * the switch happens at 0.9 V (nominal).
    *
    * * The appropriate Wait states values are set for Flash using the 
    * Cy_SysLib_SetWaitStates() function. Refer to the System Library (syslib) 
    * driver for more details.
    *
    * In general, use the next sequence to obtain SIMO Buck 0.9 V (nominal):
    * 1) Set the appropriate Wait states for 0.9 V, by calling 
    * Cy_SysLib_SetWaitStates(true, hfClkFreqMz), where hfClkFreqMz -
    * the desired frequency of HfClk0 in MHz.
    * 
    * 2) Set 0.9 V (nominal) for the LDO regulator.
    *
    * 3) Switch the regulators by calling the Cy_SysPm_SwitchToSimoBuck() function.
    *
    * To obtain SIMO Buck 1.1 V (nominal) use the next sequence:
    * 1) Set the appropriate Wait states for 0.9 V by calling 
    * Cy_SysLib_SetWaitStates(true, hfClkFreqMz), where hfClkFreqMz -
    * the desired frequency of HfClk0 in MHz
    * 
    * 2) Set 0.9 V (nominal) for the LDO regulator.
    *
    * 3) Switch the regulators by calling the Cy_SysPm_SwitchToSimoBuck() function.
    *
    * 4) Change the SIMO Buck output voltage by calling the 
    * Cy_SysPm_SimoBuckSetVoltage1(CY_SYSPM_SIMO_BUCK_OUT1_VOLTAGE_1_1V).
    *
    * 5) Set the appropriate Wait states for LP by calling 
    * Cy_SysLib_SetWaitStates(false, hfClkFreqMz), where hfClkFreqMz -
    * the desired frequency of HfClk0 in MHz
    *
    * \warning The system cannot recognize when Vccd is settled at actual
    * 0.9 V or 1.1 V for transition, because this voltage depends on the conditions 
    * including the load current. The firmware works with the 
    * nominal 0.9 V and 1.1 V voltages.
    *
    * \warning The Flash access time when the core
    * output voltage is 0.9 V (nominal) is longer than at 1.1 V (nominal). 
    * Therefore, the clock to the Flash should be decreased. Use the
    * Cy_SysLib_SetWaitStates() function to set the appropriate Wait state values 
    * for Flash. Call the Cy_SysLib_SetWaitStates() function before 
    * Cy_SysPm_SwitchToSimoBuck() if you want to change the voltage 
    * to 0.9 V (nominal). Call the Cy_SysLib_SetWaitStates() function after 
    * Cy_SysPm_SwitchToSimoBuck() if you change the voltage from 0.9 V (nominal)
    * to 1.1 V (nominal).
    * 
    * \warning There is no way to go back to the Linear regulator after the SIMO 
    * Buck regulator supplies a core. The function switches off the LDO.
    *
    * In addition, if the 0.9 V (nominal) output is set, the Flash works 
    * in the Read-only operation.
    *
    * If the 1.1 V (nominal) output is set, the Flash works in the Read and Write 
    * operation and clock frequencies may be increased up to the static 
    * timing closure limits for a new voltage. 
    * Refer to the device TRM for more details.

    * The function is applicable for devices with the SIMO Buck regulator.
